# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge, the task was to create an earthquake visualization using a dataset from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php. The dataset selected was all earthquakes from the poast 7 days. This data was then imported and visualized through leaflet.

Data markers were placed to reflect the magnitude, depth and location. The larger markers reflect the higher the magnitude. A legened was added cooresponding to the depth.
